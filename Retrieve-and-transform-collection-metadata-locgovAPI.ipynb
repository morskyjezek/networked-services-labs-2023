    "# Extracting and Transforming Metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook involves many steps, but each of the main steps is signposted with headings that align with the initial outline below. As previously, we will walk through the steps in class, but at this point you have most of the tools to read through and reconstruct a process like this on your own, so this work will be more self-guided. The general process here follows the generalized \"Extract - Transform - Load\" process, which is frequently the abstract model for pulling data from one system, transporting, cleaning, and outputting to another system, which is the goal here: extract the metadata from the Library of Congress, change it into a structure that makes sense to Omeka, then ingest that data and associated content.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing the assignment associated with this notebook, you should: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Have a conceptual and a practical understanding of how collection metadata is made available by a REST API.\n",
    "* Be able to explain the concept of metadata extraction and transformation.\n",
    "* Create a structure for documenting metadata practices in a collection or repository (a Metadata Application Profile) and implement that structure for transformations. \n",
    "* Use programming to work with data supplied by an API in JSON format, to manage and transform useful parts of that data into CSV format.\n",
    "* Create ingest-ready collection metadata that conforms to Dublin Core and other digital collection metadata standards, which can be used to load content into another site (in this case, an Omeka S site). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The main steps outlined in this notebook are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Extract the metadata.** This may be done in whatever way works for you. As illustrated here, there are two main steps that involve requesting JSON data from the Library of Congress: \n",
    "  1. Get collections list - using the requests library, make a request to the library of congress API to get the list of items in the \"Free to Use\" libraries collection. Write this to a local file (here called `collection_items_list.csv` and in the `data` directory). \n",
    "  1. Get item metadata - using the list from the previous step, use that a source to query each item in the collection to get details about it. Save the JSON responses locally so we can extract information from them in the next steps. (In this example, you will have around 60 files, but a maximum of 62 as of September 2022. This number may vary when you run this code yourself since the website may have different response rates.)\n",
    "* **Transform the metadata.** As illustrated here, there are three substeps: develop the conceptual model for your transformation (expressed in a Metadata Application Profile and an implementation of the MAP in a crosswalk), test the implementation on a small subset, then run your transformation on the entire set.\n",
    "  1. Draft a metadata crosswalk - this is an exploratory activity and you will need to take some time examining one or two sample responses from the previous step to identify the attributes that you want to extract (the goal is to identify the information that you want to import to your Omeka site collection, essentially we are going to recreate the collection), to see how to extract these from the JSON, and to write a test transformation in the next step. This is largely conceptual and, although it is sketched out in this notebook will not use python like the other steps here. That said, the next step does require this step. \n",
    "  1. Develop your transformation script with a small subset of the metadata. In this case, one record.\n",
    "  1. Transform the data you've gathered in JSON into a CSV file according to the metadata crosswalk you've developed. The goal in this step is to create a CSV that we can use to import items into your Omeka site (using the CSV Import module). Note that the code outlined here suggests how all of these data elements may be extracted and transformed, but it does not necessarily output all of the elements that you will need to complete your assignment. In other words, there is still work to do to complete this code, but you are welcome to adopt or reuse the code here.  \n",
    "* **Load the metadata** into your target system, in this case Omeka which we are using as a display platform. This step is not described in this notebook, because it requires the use of the CSV developed here to be ingested to your Omeka site. Without the above steps, however, you wouldn't be able to directly display these items. "

    "Below is a start. This is going to get a bit complicated, but identify at least 10 fields that you want to move into the new site. Consider using DublinCore, but also at least one field from another schema, I would suggest MODS (more of a bibliographic schema and allows for more granularity than DublinCore), which is also supported by Omeka. Plus, you should be able to find MODS information for most (if not all) items in any of these sets. For example, looking at resource `highsm.20336`, note the last field in the item metadata is a URL to an `item` page: https://www.loc.gov/item/2012630017/. That item page links to MODS and DublinCore records.\n",

    "The goal of this final step is to create a CSV file, which will be possible to import into your Omeka site. It may seem like it's taken a long time to get to this point... but remember, when this works you will be importing around 60 items into the site at one time, so if you can get all of this to work for an even larger set of materials, you will be saving quite a lot of time in the future when you need to import items. Even if you were to collect the items piecemeal, which would need a different workflow than illustrated here, you can accomplish similar goals by recording metadata for each item consistently and in a spreadsheet, which you can then use to import the items in batch.\n",
