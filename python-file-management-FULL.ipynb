    "\n",
    "This notebook explains and illustrates some of the basic operations of working with files in Python. The notebook begins with a basic look at reading and writing files (opening and saving) with a look through an example that extracts specific information from one file then writes it to a new file. After that, the notebook introduces a few modules that will help build an inventory of basic system information including filenames, locations (paths), and sizes. Once such information is etracted, you can use it to create an inventory or manifest. \n",
    "\n",
    "As anyone who has worked with files and operating systems will know, the operating system data about files is often contextual and depends on the system in which it was created or saved. Other information, like user profiles, access controls, and encryption are typically not reflected in this sort of information and that context will require other methods to preserve.\n",

    "1. Write a script that uses `os.listdir()` for each of the directories in the `webfiles-samples` directory. You can put in the path names directly as variables, but you should use the `os.path.join()` function to create filepaths that do not depend on your inputting the exact filepath string, which will vary across operating systems.\n",
    "1. Write a script that uses `os.scandir()` to check whether or not the entities in the director are files or directories. The script should output a count of files and a count of directories.\n",
    "1. Examine the examples above that use `os.walk()`. What is the difference between this and the previous two functions? In some ways it lets you get deeper into the file structure, so please explain your observation in a sentence or two.  \n",
    "1. Create a script that will print out an inventory of all the files in the assets folder `webfiles-samples`. The list should include the filename of the file, the directory path for the file, the full path to the file, and the file size. You may include any other information that you think is important. Call your script file `inventory_script.py`.\n",
    "1. Extend the previous script: Create a script that will print out an inventory of all the files in the assets folder `webfiles-samples`. The inventory should be a CSV file, and it should include the filename of the file, the directory path for the file, the full path to the file, and the file size. You may include any other information that you think is important. Call your script file `inventory_script.py`.\n",
    "1. Extend the above script, using the techniques demonstrated here, and add in a way to determine the file extension of the file, then add the extension to the CSV output? (Hint: you could split the filename string, right?)\n",
    "1. Write a script that can walk through a series of directories and identify files based on their file extension. For example, perhaps you want to count the number of .pdf files or .jpg. Create file that can look for this information and then tally the files. Then, have the program output the list of filenames and filepaths in a CSV file. Call this file `extension_detector.py`. "

    "1. Building on the above examples, can you a) write functions that bundle code to ask for a directory? You could call this function `create_manifest_information` and it should be able to accept a path to a directory as an argument and return the manifestInfo list. And b) write a function that would accept the manifestInfo list as an argument and create a CSV? \n",
    "1. Write a script that creates a `main` and `derivative` directory within a subdirectory that has the file's name as its name. For example, if there are two files, one named `001.jpg` and `audition.wav`, there should be a directory named `001` and another named `audition`. Within these, there should be main and derivative folders. The original files should be in the `main` folder. Call this file `main_and_derivatives.py`."
